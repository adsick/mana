# Mana
- [ ] structure
  - [ ] graph
  - [ ] greedy vs lazy
  - [ ] context and state
  - [ ] where to store commands and atoms?
  - [ ] 'universal' atoms? (Any, Wait, Optional, Greedy, Lazy...)


# Graph
- [x] rewrite Graph so that edges have associated data, update first playground accordingly.
- [ ] consider using petgraph? 
  this will probably increase build time, as there are many features that won't be needed.
